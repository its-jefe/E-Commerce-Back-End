# eCommerce Back End

## Description

The challenge was to build the back end for an e-commerce site. 

I took a working Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

Starter code from [here](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/fantastic-umbrella)  

## Usage

[Usage Video](https://its-jefe.github.io/videos/13.html) walks through setup and API CRUD testing
> Please excuse my video is cut at the bottom for the first minute. I will fix this but if not be kind ;) (all the commands can be seen after executing)

The command line code that I use is as follows...

1. Start mysql ```mysql -u root -p``` then enter your password

2. Run ```source db/schema.sql``` to create the database then ```exit```

3. Run ```npm run seed``` to seed the database with test data

4. Run ```npm start``` then head over to Insomnia 

```
